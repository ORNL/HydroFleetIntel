Part-level info tables are used to populate characteristics displayed in the info panel of a specific part. 

These characteristics are primarily nameplate data obtained from sufficiency matrix developed by Jim Miller
Part IDs were assigned to rows inside the suff. matrix and then used to create .csv files collecting information from all rows, these .csv files are the 'part-level info tables'.

For the generator, information  only needed to be collected from sheets six and eight, expanding beyond the generator will involve building on the R file. 


asset_4_1_3_links.csv was used to create 4.1.3generator.csv, which is used to populate characteristics in the app's info panel
